## Overview of package material plugins

Go's user documentation has an overview of package material plugins. Please see [that](http://www.go.cd/documentation/user/current/extension_points/package_repository_extension.html).

Go provides two ways of writing a package material plugin:
* [JSON API - Message based](json_message_based_package_material_extension.md)
* [Java API based (Deprecated)](writing_go_package_material_plugin.md)
