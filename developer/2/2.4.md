## 2.4 How to add a database migration

Similar to configuration, from time to time, the Go database needs to be migrated as well, to accommodate new features or other changes. Go uses [DBDeploy](https://code.google.com/p/dbdeploy/) to perform this operation.

> Explaining by example, I'll take the case of how the database migration 1401001 was added

### 2.4.1 Introducing a new database migration

As part of 14.1, Go had one database migration to recreate triggers because of a name refactoring that was done. The below file naming scheme is followed for database migrations
```
<2-digit-major-release-version><2-digit-minor-release-version><3-digit-migration-sequence-number>_<description-of-the-migration>.sql
```

For example, for the first migration of 14.1 release, the migration was

```bash
~/projects/go$ touch ./server/db/migrate/h2deltas/1401001_recreating_trigger_because_of_cruise_to_go_change.sql
```

- 2-digit-major-release-version : **14**
- 2-digit-minor-release-version : **01**
- 3-digit-migration-sequence-number: **001**
- description-of-the-migration: **recreating_trigger_because_of_cruise_to_go_change**

### 2.4.2 Writing the DML/DDL

Following the DBDeploy [semantics](https://code.google.com/p/dbdeploy/wiki/GettingStarted), the 1401001 migration was created as

```sql
DROP TRIGGER lastTransitionedTimeUpdate;
CREATE TRIGGER lastTransitionedTimeUpdate AFTER INSERT ON buildStateTransitions FOR EACH ROW CALL "com.thoughtworks.go.server.sqlmigration.Migration_230007";

--//@UNDO

DROP TRIGGER lastTransitionedTimeUpdate;
CREATE TRIGGER lastTransitionedTimeUpdate AFTER INSERT ON buildStateTransitions FOR EACH ROW CALL "com.thoughtworks.go.server.sqlmigration.Migration_230007";
```

If you now run

```bash
./bn cruise:prepare
```

and then bring up a Development Server, you will see that the migration runs.
