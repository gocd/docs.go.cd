      <description>Clean up after canceling a task When you have jobs that take a long time to run, it is very useful to have the capability to cancel it when you already know it will fail.
By default, GoCD will kill any currently running tasks . There are two other alternatives to this behaviour
 Specify a task to clean up your environment. This could kill the processes and cleanup any existing state.</description>

      <description>GoCD Command Repository Introduction This feature is an enhancement to Custom Commands in GoCD. Rather than start from scratch with command name and arguments, you now have the option to look up a command from a repository of useful commands maintained by the Go team. The lookup provides a starting point, you may need to edit the arguments, specify a working directory etc. Once saved, the behaviour is the same as a manually entered custom command.</description>

      <description>GoCD Configuration repository GoCD&amp;rsquo;s configuration is version controlled in a local git repository - config.git hosted on the same machine as the GoCD server. The repo is available at &amp;lt;GoCD server installation directory&amp;gt;/db/config.git. Any changes to the config, either through file-system, API or GoCD configuration UI is saved as a new commit in this repo. This allows auditing of all changes made to the configuration.
NOTE: This repo must not be altered externally as this will lead to errors in GoCD.</description>

      <description>GoCD Fan-in Dependency Management GoCD supports fan-in dependency resolution for pipelines that are on auto trigger. Fan-in material resolution will ensure that a pipeline triggers only when all its upstream pipelines have triggered off the same version of an ancestor pipeline or material. This will be the case when you have multiple components building in separate pipelines which all have the same ancestor and you want downstream pipelines to all use the same version of the artifact from the ancestor pipeline.</description>

      <description>Initial setup Assumption: You already have a setup resembling Figure 1, with a GoCD Server which uses an external PostgreSQL database. To configure GoCD to use PostgreSQL please refer the configure PostgreSQL documentation.
Enable replication on the primary PostgreSQL instance The recommended replication setup is PostgreSQL streaming replication with log shipping . In this case, the two PostgreSQL servers, called &amp;ldquo;Primary&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Standby&amp;rdquo;, will be setup such that the standby continuously replicates the primary.</description>

      <description>GoCD Business Continuity This feature makes an active-standby (or active-passive) setup of GoCD Servers possible, to decrease the impact of a failure of your primary GoCD Server or its database node. During a primary GoCD Server failure, it is important that all the agents can be pivoted to use the standby server, without having to be reconfigured. This setup allows for that as well.
To implement a set up such as this, the recommendation will be to set up redundancy for nearly every moving piece (detailed later in this document), but based on your situation, you might want to reduce certain redundancies, if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to accept the risk.</description>

      <description>Logging Introduction You can turn on additional logging to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with the GoCD server and agent.
Log location To change where the GoCD server logs or GoCD agent logs are stored, use the system properties gocd.server.log.dir and gocd.agent.log.dir respectively. Refer to the system properties documentation to find out how to set the system property on the gocd server or agent.
Note: The system property deals with configuring the log location for the GoCD server or agent related logs and not the plugin logs.</description>

      <description>Maintenance Mode Note: Using this feature requires atleast version 19.1.0 of the GoCD server.
The GoCD system includes a lot of internal subsystems and processes, which continuously do work. Some examples include the material subsystem which takes care of polling for materials, the scheduling subsystem which automatically starts pipelines and stages, the agent subsystem which continuously keeps tracks of agent states and provides them jobs to run, etc.
Maintenance mode is a maintenance mode which can be utilized by the GoCD system administrator to safely restart or upgrade the GoCD server without having any running jobs reschedule when the server is back up.</description>

      <description>Monitoring and Switching Over to Secondary Server Monitoring the progress of the sync As mentioned in the details part of the &amp;ldquo;Setup a standby (secondary) GoCD Server&amp;rdquo; section, the standby dashboard shows the progress of the sync, and refreshes itself every few seconds. An entry showing up in red denotes the sync hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened, whereas an entry in black denotes that the standby is in sync with the server. You should monitor that the Last Config/Plugins Update Time under Primary Details and Last Successful Sync time under Standby Details are not off by a huge time gap.</description>

      <description>Install multiple agents on the same machine In order to fully utilize your hardware, it is often useful to install multiple agents on a single machine.
See the file README-running-multiple-agents.md in your GoCD agent installation for details on setting up multiple agents.
On Linux, it is usually available in /usr/share/doc/go-agent. The recommended way to get the instructions file is to find it in the ZIP distribution of the specific version of the GoCD agent you want to run multiple instances of.</description>

      <description>Pipelines as code GoCD can store pipeline definitions in a source code repository (either in your application&amp;rsquo;s repository, or in a separate repository). This way, you can keep your pipeline definitions out of GoCD and under version control, and manage them externally. A poller in the GoCD server will check periodically for modifications to your external pipeline definitions, and merge them with the pipeline data already present in GoCD&amp;rsquo;s main XML configuration file.</description>

      <description>Perform GoCD server backups on a schedule To run a GoCD server backup at a given time, use a timer. Timers understand a cron-like specification for when to perform a backup. The GoCD server can be optionally configured to invoke a post-backup script to allow you to copy the backup to an external machine or service (like AWS&amp;rsquo; S3).
The post backup script The post backup script, if configured, will be invoked regardless of success or failure of the script, and will receive the following environment variables:</description>

      <description>UI testing Because GoCD installs itself as a service (Windows) or daemon (Linux) by default, getting GoCD agents to interact with your operating system&amp;rsquo;s windowing environment can cause problems. Access to a windowing environment is usually required for testing UI applications or for driving browsers for web testing. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
Windows The first step is to disable the GoCD agent service. To do this:
