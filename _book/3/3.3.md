# 3.3 Caching - EhCache

<a href="http://ehcache.org/" target="_blank">Ehcache</a> store is used for in-memory caching in Go.
This is largely used for two purposes:
- [Second level cache in Hibernate](#second-level-cache-in-hibernate)
- [Go's custom caching of data](#custom-caching-of-data)

### Second level cache in Hibernate

The second level cache in Hibernate is configured to use an Ehcache store. The cache-store configuration can be found in `WEB-INF/ehcache.xml`.

### Custom caching of data

Many of the query results and computed information needs to be cached to better the performance of future queries. This caching is done by the DAOs and services and it is also their responsibility to invalidate the cache when need be. The cached data is maintained in an Ehcache store.
`com.thoughtworks.cruise.server.cache.CruiseCache` is a wrapper over Ehcache which encapsulates all interactions with the cache store. CruiseCacheFactory.createCache is the factory method to instantiate and configure the cache. ( Check `WEB-INF/applicationContext-dataLocalAccess.xml`)
