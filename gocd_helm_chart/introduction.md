# Introduction

## Get started with GoCD on Kubernetes using the GoCD Helm Chart. 

*Note: This guide assumes that the users are familiar with the [Helm package management](https://helm.sh/) for Kubernetes.*

Using the GoCD Helm Chart, you will be able to install a set of Kubernetes resources on a Kubernetes cluster. (for a successful installation of the GoCD server and agents in the cluster).

To get started, you'll need: 

1. The GoCD Helm Chart - this is currently present in the [incubator repo](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/incubator/gocd).
2. The required [pre-requisites](prerequisites.md) for a Kubernetes install before you start with the helm installation.
