# Introduction

The GoCD Helm Chart can be used to install a set of kubernetes resources on a kubernetes cluster for a successful installation of the GoCD server and agents in the cluster.

Note:This guide assumes that the users are familiar with the Helm package management for Kubernetes. For those of you who are unfamiliar with helm, please refer to the [helm documentation]() before starting with the GoCD Helm chart.

The GoCD Helm Chart is currently present in the [incubator repo](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/incubator/gocd).

Refer to the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) section to start with the helm installation.
