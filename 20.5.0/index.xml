      <guid>/configuration/access_tokens.html</guid>
      <description>Access Tokens From GoCD server version 19.2.0 onwards, you will be able to create personal access tokens to access GoCD API(s). This will allow users to make an API call without specifying their credentials (username &amp;amp; password) as a part of API request headers.
Usage instructions   A token can be used to access GoCD APIs and cctray.xml by passing it in API header.
 Before 19.2.0

      <guid>/configuration/quick_pipeline_setup.html</guid>
      <description>Add a New Pipeline There are many ways of creating pipelines in GoCD:
 You can create them by using Pipelines as Code, by adding pipeline definitions to a repository in formats such as Yaml, JSON, Groovy, etc. You can use GoCD&amp;rsquo;s extensive APIs to create a pipeline. See Pipeline Config API. You can use GoCD&amp;rsquo;s UI to create a pipeline (see below). By cloning an existing pipeline.  New Pipeline Wizard Clicking on the Admin -&amp;gt; Pipelines menu item will take you to the pipelines administration page.</description>

      <description>GoCD Artifact integrity verification Overview GoCD verifies artifact integrity to ensure that they are unchanged from the point of origin. While executing a job, GoCD applies the following rules if the checksum of the downloaded artifact does not match the checksum at the time of generation of the artifact.
 If the artifact was uploaded using the artifact API, a warning is displayed in the console output for the job If the downloaded artifact is different from the point of generation, the job will be failed with an error in the console output for the job.</description>

      <guid>/configuration/dev_authentication.html</guid>
      <description>Authentication A newly installed GoCD server does not require users to authenticate. This is great for a trial. However, it is one of the first things you should change, as soon as you decide to use GoCD more widely.
GoCD has two methods of authentication built into it: Password-file based authentication and LDAP/Active Directory authentication. You can also choose from a collection of community-maintained plugins for other methods of authentication, such as using Google or GitHub OAuth.</description>

      <description>Authorization With no security switched on, there is of course no authorization either. Once you have configured security, the default is that any user can perform any operation. However, GoCD can limit certain operations to particular Users or Roles, and manage membership of those Roles.
Administrators GoCD allows you to restrict the users who can perform certain functions. Administrators is a special role that allows its members to perform any action in GoCD.</description>

      <description>Auto registration of remote agents As a GoCD administrator, you can auto approve remote agents by using a shared key between the GoCD Agent and GoCD Server.
 Add an attribute named &amp;ldquo;agentAutoRegisterKey&amp;rdquo;, for e.g., agentAutoRegisterKey=&amp;quot;388b633a88de126531afa41eff9aa69e&amp;rdquo;, in the server configuration fragment, in case it is not present.  &amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; encoding=&amp;#34;utf-8&amp;#34;?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cruise xmlns:xsi=&amp;#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&amp;#34; xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=&amp;#34;cruise-config.xsd&amp;#34; schemaVersion=&amp;#34;75&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;server agentAutoRegisterKey=&amp;#34;388b633a88de126531afa41eff9aa69e&amp;#34;&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/cruise&amp;gt;   On the remote GoCD Agent machine, create a file named &amp;lt;agent_installation_directory&amp;gt;/config/autoregister.</description>

      <description>Backup GoCD Server You can use GoCD&amp;rsquo;s administration interface to perform an One-Click Backup of Go. You can also perform a backup using the API.
Steps to initiate backup   After you are logged into gocd, click on the Admin &amp;gt; Backup link, and click the Perform Backup button.
 Note: GoCD will be unusable during the backup process.
   Backup time is proportional to the database and configuration size.</description>

      <description>Discover what&amp;rsquo;s in an GoCD environment Before deploying something into production, it is often useful to know what is currently there.
Example usage For this example, we will assume we have a stage name &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; that will automatically deploy a binary onto a production server
 Start at the environments page   Click on the name of your &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; stage   The stage details page will show every time GoCD has deployed your application  </description>

      <guid>/configuration/dev_choose_when_stage_runs.html</guid>
      <description>Choose when a GoCD stage runs Often there are steps in your pipeline that you do not want to happen automatically. For example, you might want to keep binaries from being created for every pipeline (to prevent running out of disk space) or want to choose when your code is deployed to production. Stages in GoCD can be marked as &amp;lsquo;manual&amp;rsquo; just for this purpose.
You can create a manual pipeline by setting the first stage to manual.</description>

      <description>Clean up after canceling a task When you have jobs that take a long time to run, it is very useful to have the capability to cancel it when you already know it will fail.
By default, GoCD will kill any currently running tasks . There are two other alternatives to this behaviour
 Specify a task to clean up your environment. This could kill the processes and cleanup any existing state.</description>

      <description>GoCD Command Repository Introduction This feature is an enhancement to Custom Commands in GoCD. Rather than start from scratch with command name and arguments, you now have the option to look up a command from a repository of useful commands maintained by the Go team. The lookup provides a starting point, you may need to edit the arguments, specify a working directory etc. Once saved, the behaviour is the same as a manually entered custom command.</description>

      <description>Concurrent Modifications to GoCD&amp;rsquo;s Configuration GoCD handles concurrent modifications to its configuration. Multiple modifications are merged and saved successfully. Modifications to the same area of configuration would result in a conflict.
Note: Configuration file is maintained in git version control system. GoCD leverages git&amp;rsquo;s merge feature to merge changes from multiple users. As expected, concurrent changes to the same section by users would result in a conflict.
Successful Merge In case of a successful merge, user would see a success message as below:</description>

      <description>GoCD Configuration repository GoCD&amp;rsquo;s configuration is version controlled in a local git repository - config.git hosted on the same machine as the GoCD server. The repo is available at &amp;lt;GoCD server installation directory&amp;gt;/db/config.git. Any changes to the config, either through file-system, API or GoCD configuration UI is saved as a new commit in this repo. This allows auditing of all changes made to the configuration.
NOTE: This repo must not be altered externally as this will lead to errors in GoCD.</description>

      <description>Configure a GoCD agent to connect to a server through a proxy server. Note: Using this feature requires atleast version 17.11.0 of the GoCD server and agent.
Proxy support is configured with GoCD agents by passing certain system properties to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on startup. These properties follow the conventions defined by the JVM:
 http.proxyHost http.proxyPort (default: 80) http.nonProxyHosts (default: localhost|127.*|[::1]) https.proxyHost https.proxyPort socksProxyHost socksProxyPort (default: 1080) socksProxyVersion (default: 5)  To configure an agent to use a proxy edit the wrapper-properties.</description>

      <description>Configuring GoCD server details Artifact repository configuration GoCD needs no configuration once installed. However, we recommend that you create a separate partition on your computer&amp;rsquo;s hard disk for GoCD server artifacts. The artifact repository can grow in size very quickly. If located on your system&amp;rsquo;s main partition you may experience data loss and unpredictable application behaviour as the disk fills up.
Once you have created a new disk partition, you need to tell GoCD where to find it.</description>

      <description>Deleting Pipelines Deleting a pipeline removes an existing pipeline from the config.
 Warning: Pipeline history is not removed from the database and artifacts are not removed from artifact storage, which may cause conflicts if a pipeline with the same name is later re-created.
 To delete a pipeline:
 Navigate to the &amp;ldquo;Admin&amp;rdquo; menu and click the &amp;ldquo;Pipelines&amp;rdquo; item. Locate the pipeline that needs to be deleted. In that row, click on the &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; icon.</description>

      <description>Deploy specific revisions of the materials to an environment GoCD allows you to hand pick which revision of your materials you would like to deploy to your environment. This is a a very common requirement on larger projects which have multiple materials in their deployment pipeline. Sometimes you may wish to have control over which revision of the application is deployed to a particular environment (say UAT).
Select specific revisions of materials to deploy Consider the case where a deployment pipeline &amp;lsquo;deploy_bookstore&amp;rsquo; has 2 materials - Material &amp;lsquo;svn&amp;rsquo; and upstream pipeline &amp;lsquo;bookstore&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Releasing into an environment One of the most useful aspects of having your build mapped as a pipeline, is being able to know exactly what is in a particular environment. For example, you might have a User Acceptance Testing environment into which you want GoCD to automatically deploy your binary. Due to process restriction within your company, you might want to manually install a binary yourself, but have GoCD still retain the information of what is currently released.</description>

      <description>GoCD Elastic Agents Introduction Elastic Agents is an extension-point in GoCD that allows for on-demand agents which are created and provisioned by an elastic-agent plugin when there are jobs to be executed, and terminated when the agents are running idle. These agents can be in a data center or in the cloud or both, and may be physical or virtual.
Developers can start building their own elastic-agent plugins by forking the skeleton plugin and looking at a sample docker plugin, docker swarm plugin as an example reference implementation.</description>

      <description>GoCD Fan-in Dependency Management GoCD supports fan-in dependency resolution for pipelines that are on auto trigger. Fan-in material resolution will ensure that a pipeline triggers only when all its upstream pipelines have triggered off the same version of an ancestor pipeline or material. This will be the case when you have multiple components building in separate pipelines which all have the same ancestor and you want downstream pipelines to all use the same version of the artifact from the ancestor pipeline.</description>

By default, polling occurs every minute and ten materials at a time. The polling interval and the number of materials to be polled simultaneously are configurable.
GoCD uses SCM commands to poll for changes. For example, to check for any new changes in SVN repository the following command is used:
svn log --non-interactive --xml -v -r HEAD:&amp;#39;revision&amp;#39; &amp;#39;repository-URL&amp;#39; The SCM command used by GoCD server can hang with no output.</description>

      <description>Pipeline locking: Ensure only one instance of a GoCD pipeline can run at the same time Sometimes you want to ensure that only a single instance of a pipeline can run at a time. This is important if the stages of a pipeline are interrelated. For example the first stage may set up an environment that is used by the next stage in the pipeline.
If a pipeline is locked then GoCD will not allow any other instance of that pipeline to be scheduled until the currently running one has been completed.</description>

      <description>Maintenance Mode Note: Using this feature requires atleast version 19.1.0 of the GoCD server.
The GoCD system includes a lot of internal subsystems and processes, which continuously do work. Some examples include the material subsystem which takes care of polling for materials, the scheduling subsystem which automatically starts pipelines and stages, the agent subsystem which continuously keeps tracks of agent states and provides them jobs to run, etc.
Maintenance mode is a maintenance mode which can be utilized by the GoCD system administrator to safely restart or upgrade the GoCD server without having any running jobs reschedule when the server is back up.</description>

      <description>Managing artifacts and reports Because all your work is done on remote agents, GoCD provides a mechanism for files to be automatically uploaded to GoCD server following the completion of every job. These files can then be accessed via the GoCD server dashboard, or via the RESTful API.
Publishing artifacts The first step in using the artifact repository is to tell GoCD which files you want to publish. To do this just specify the path to the file or directory relative to the root of the source control checkout.</description>

      <description>Managing dependencies Sometimes you need more complex triggers than a simple pipeline of stages and jobs. In particular, you may want a pipeline to trigger based on the result of a stage in another pipeline. This is possible by adding pipelines as materials.
Creating a dependency Say we have two pipelines - upstream_pipeline and downstream_pipeline . We want downstream_pipeline to automatically trigger following the successful completion of the stage AutoStage1 in pipeline upstream_pipeline.</description>

      <description>Managing environments GoCD is configured using an XML configuration file. This file can be edited through the GoCD server dashboard. GoCD allows you to edit sections of the configuration independently and will check the syntax of the configuration before it saves it again. You can also edit the full XML file if you wish, by clicking on the Config XML section of the Administration tab.
Creating a new environment An Environment is a grouping of pipelines and agents.</description>

      <description>Managing Users GoCD&amp;rsquo;s user management features allow you to control access to GoCD and grant role-based permissions.
All user management features depend on an authentication mechanism having been configured in GoCD. Please ensure you have at least one authentication mechanism enabled before attempting to use any of the features mentioned in this chapter.
Adding Users  Click on the menu item: Admin -&amp;gt; Users Management. Click the &amp;ldquo;Import User&amp;rdquo; button Enter a name/email to search for (minimum 2 characters) and click &amp;ldquo;Search&amp;rdquo; This will perform a search across all authentication mechanisms configured (across authentication mechanisms such as passwordfile, AD, etc) From the list of results, select the user to add and click &amp;ldquo;Import User&amp;rdquo;  Assigning Roles Roles allow you to group a set of users with similar functional duties and grant them a common set of permissions.</description>

      <description>Install multiple agents on the same machine In order to fully utilize your hardware, it is often useful to install multiple agents on a single machine.
See the file README-running-multiple-agents.md in your GoCD agent installation for details on setting up multiple agents.
On Linux, it is usually available in /usr/share/doc/go-agent. The recommended way to get the instructions file is to find it in the ZIP distribution of the specific version of the GoCD agent you want to run multiple instances of.</description>

      <description>Notifications It is often useful to receive an email when certain status changes occur in a stage. For example, a developer might want to know when their own check-in has broken the build. Alternatively, a manager might want an email whenever a project is deployed into production. Both of these scenarios can be covered by Notification Filters
Notifications will only work if Security is enabled and mailhost information is correct.</description>

      <guid>/faq/ordering_of_pipelines.html</guid>
      <description>Ordering of pipelines in GoCD In GoCD, we use two distinct types of ordering of pipelines:
 Schedule order: Chronological order in which pipelines are scheduled. Natural order: Chronological order of pipelines based on material modifications  In most cases the schedule order and natural order match. The user checks in and builds incrementally so the order in which builds are scheduled is the same as the relative order in which changes are checked in.</description>

      <description>GoCD Package Material Introduction Poll from GoCD packages and more from GoCD 13.3 onwards. Pipelines in GoCD can poll packages in repositories similar to how they poll version control systems. A build typically consumes source code maintained in a version control system (VCS/SCM). What about a typical deployment? Increasingly, the input for deployments is the build result packaged as:
 jar, war or ear file in case of Java nuget/ chocolatey package in case of .</description>

      <description>GoCD Pipeline Labeling GoCD maintains an internal counter to identify a pipeline. This number increases by 1 for each build. By default, GoCD will use this counter as the pipeline label. This label is also passed to your build as an environment variable: GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER . The pipeline counter increases even if a build fails.
Changing the default pipeline label You can create a custom label by setting the Label Template field on your pipeline.</description>

      <description>GoCD Pipeline Scheduling Pipelines get scheduled automatically by default. Please see the knowledge base article in the Also see section below. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to disable automatic scheduling.
Disable automatic scheduling Unchecking the &amp;ldquo;Automatic Pipeline Scheduling&amp;rdquo; checkbox above disables auto scheduling. Actually this is the same as marking first stage as manual. We have just surfaced the option at a pipeline level to make it easier to spot. Please note though that this isn&amp;rsquo;t really a pipeline level configuration.</description>

      <description>Pipelines as code GoCD can store pipeline definitions in a source code repository (either in your application&amp;rsquo;s repository, or in a separate repository). This way, you can keep your pipeline definitions out of GoCD and under version control, and manage them externally. A poller in the GoCD server will check periodically for modifications to your external pipeline definitions, and merge them with the pipeline data already present in GoCD&amp;rsquo;s main XML configuration file.</description>

Each plugin is assigned an identifier which is determined by the id attribute provided in plugin metadata file packaged along with the plugin jar. If the metadata file is not packaged, plugin jar file name will be taken as plugin id. Plugins are classified into two categories - Bundled and External. During startup, GoCD server would try to load all the plugins.</description>

      <description>Policy A policy is a set of permissions for GoCD entities such as environments, configuration repositories, etc. The policy defines the access of a GoCD entity for the users in a role. GoCD supports a restrictive model of access i.e. until access is granted, the entity can&amp;rsquo;t be accessed by anyone (except admins).
A permission consists of 3 values:
 Type: The type of GoCD entity. Supported values are environment, config_repo, cluster_profile, elastic_agent_profile.</description>

      <description>Publishing artifacts When executing a job on an agent there are often artifacts created that we need to keep around. For example, JUnit creates xml reports that GoCD is able to parse in order to help you understand why the build is broken. You can use GoCD with any JUnit style xml reports. Or you might create a flash video of your UI tests that we want displayed in GoCD. You can upload any html file from your build and view it in GoCD.</description>

      <description>GoCD Dependency Management When you have non-trivial dependency pipeline chains, you may have concerns about how dependent pipelines and materials interact. For example, code and tests are checked in as part of the same commit. But code is built and tested in sequence, so the same material version has to be used for pipelines that build and test your code. This section covers some Dependency Management concepts and how GoCD handles certain complex scenarios.</description>

      <description>Running out of disk space After you&amp;rsquo;ve had GoCD running for a while, you may notice the following warning box when browsing GoCD:
If you don&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up seeing the following error:
GoCD will stop scheduling new pipelines until you make more room, either by compressing large files, attaching a larger hard drive, or by deleting unused artifacts. You could also let GoCD manage artifact disk space by enabling auto purge of old artifacts.</description>

      <description>Getting Started with GoCD on Kubernetes Explanation of the sample pipelines In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll explain the details of each of the pipelines imported in the previous section.
1. Build and publish image This pipeline builds an application artifact and publishes it to an artifact store.
The material A GoCD pipeline&amp;rsquo;s material is the trigger for a pipeline. Often it is a source code repository. It could also be another GoCD repository.</description>

      <description>SCM Material Introduction A build typically consumes source code maintained in a version control system (VCS/SCM). GoCD has built-in support for Git, Mercurial, SVN, TFS &amp;amp; Perforce. Users can use SCM plugins to integrate with other SCMs.
SCMs and Materials Unlike built-in VCS/SCM materials, the material definition in case of plugin SCMs is not contained within the pipeline definition. They are global entities. Many pipelines may have material definitions referring to the same SCM.</description>

      <description>Secrets Management Managing secrets is hard, ideally secrets should be stored securely, secrets need to have tight access controls and should be rotated on a regular interval. There are Secret Managers in the market which specialize in solving some of these problems around handling secrets. Leveraging these solutions, GoCD provides plugin endpoints to lookup for secrets defined in an external Secrets Manager. This gives GoCD users the flexibilty to use a Secret Manager of their choice to store and manage secrets.</description>

      <description>See artifacts as sub-tabs in GoCD After uploading html reports, it is often useful to be able to easily view this information when trying to understand why the build is broken.
Example usage  Suppose we have configured GoCD to upload a flash video and html file and display it as a tab Click on the Dashboard tab   Click on the stage you want to investigate   Click on the job you want to investigate   Click on the tab you created   Clicking on the tab will load the page, which will start the video!</description>

      <description>What has changed in the current GOCD version? When updating your testing environments to a new version, it is useful to know what changes have been made since it was last updated. Since there is currently no way to get this information in GoCD automatically, there are some extra steps we must take.
Example usage For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that there is a manual &amp;ldquo;UAT&amp;rdquo; stage will automatically deploy and install an executable on your user acceptance testing machine.</description>

      <description>Perform GoCD server backups on a schedule To run a GoCD server backup at a given time, use a timer. Timers understand a cron-like specification for when to perform a backup. The GoCD server can be optionally configured to invoke a post-backup script to allow you to copy the backup to an external machine or service (like AWS&amp;rsquo; S3).
The post backup script The post backup script, if configured, will be invoked regardless of success or failure of the script, and will receive the following environment variables:</description>

      <description>Run a GoCD pipeline on a schedule To run a pipeline at a given time, use a timer. Timers understand a cron-like specification for when to run a pipeline.
Note that a pipeline will still schedule normally if changes are checked in. If the pipeline should only run according to the timer&amp;rsquo;s schedule then you should also set a manual approval for the first stage of the pipeline to stop it from automatically scheduling when materials change.</description>

      <description>UI testing Because GoCD installs itself as a service (Windows) or daemon (Linux) by default, getting GoCD agents to interact with your operating system&amp;rsquo;s windowing environment can cause problems. Access to a windowing environment is usually required for testing UI applications or for driving browsers for web testing. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
Windows The first step is to disable the GoCD agent service. To do this:

      <description>Why is the build broken? Knowing the build is broken is only the first step. Now we need to understand what caused it to break.
Example usage Usage: As a developer, I want to understand why the build is broken.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that in this case, we are on a java project using JUnit as our testing library.
 If we&amp;rsquo;re not already, we need to configure Go to upload JUnit xml reports Click on the Pipelines tab   Click on the failed stage you want to investigate   Click on the failed job   The &amp;ldquo;Failures&amp;rdquo; sub-tab should help you diagnose what is wrong with your build   If you need more information, the &amp;ldquo;Console&amp;rdquo; sub-tab contains everything that was written out to the console (including extra information from Go)  </description>
