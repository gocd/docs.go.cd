      <description>Configure a GoCD agent to connect to a server through a proxy server. Note: Using this feature requires at least version 17.11.0 of the GoCD server and agent.&#xA;Proxy support is configured with GoCD agents by passing certain system properties to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on startup. These properties follow the conventions defined by the JVM:&#xA;http.proxyHost http.proxyPort (default: 80) http.nonProxyHosts (default: localhost|127.*|[::1]) https.proxyHost https.proxyPort socksProxyHost socksProxyPort (default: 1080) socksProxyVersion (default: 5) To configure an agent to use a proxy edit the wrapper-properties.</description>

      <description>Configuring GoCD server details Artifact repository configuration GoCD needs no configuration once installed. However, we recommend that you create a separate partition on your computer&amp;rsquo;s hard disk for GoCD server artifacts. The artifact repository can grow in size very quickly. If located on your system&amp;rsquo;s main partition you may experience data loss and unpredictable application behaviour as the disk fills up.&#xA;Once you have created a new disk partition, you need to tell GoCD where to find it.</description>

      <description>Enabling GoCD to use MySQL Note: Support for MySQL was added in GoCD 20.5.0 and while a basic round of migration tests was completed, the functional test suite does not regularly run against MySQL as a part of the build pipeline. This is something to be aware of if moving to MySQL. H2 and PostgreSQL are tested thoroughly as a part of GoCD&amp;rsquo;s build pipelines.&#xA;Step 1: Install MySQL Server In order to use MySQL database with GoCD, an external MySQL database server is needed to host the GoCD Server&amp;rsquo;s database.</description>

      <description>Enabling GoCD to use PostgreSQL Database Step 1: Install PostgreSQL Server In order to use PostgreSQL database with GoCD, a PostgreSQL database server is needed to host the GoCD Server&amp;rsquo;s database. If the Postgres server is not yet initialized, it needs to be, before GoCD is able to use it. Along with PostgreSQL server, you need to install postgresql-client and postgresql-contrib packages. The postgresql-contrib package contains the citext and pgcrypto module which is necessary for the initial schema creation.</description>

      <description>Configure end-to-end transport security This section will help you configure and improve the security of the agent-to-server communication using correct SSL/TLS certificates and verification process.&#xA;The GoCD agent allows for some configuration to be able to configure and secure the end-to-end transport security to varying security levels.&#xA;The agent by default trusts any and all certificates offered to it, which may possibly allow for MITM attacks. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to improve security further, by providing your own server certificate, you may provide one of the following options before starting the agent process.</description>

      <description>GoCD hardware specifications The hardware specifications for a GoCD server depends on a number of factors, this makes it difficult to estimate upfront the required hardware specifications and requires a bit of experimentation. The hardware specifications will depend on the current needs and future expansion plans.&#xA;Also see: GoCD system requirements&#xA;Agent hardware requirements The agent hardware requirements are basically determined by the builds that are run. Running GoCD agents will introduce a slight CPU overhead (usually it can be neglected when comparing to the build process CPU requirements).</description>

      <description>Upgrading to GoCD 20.5.0 and higher GoCD 20.5.0 introduced several changes to its database implementation in order to build a more flexible model that allows integrating with multiple databases. As part of these changes GoCD changed the technologies used for automated database migrations (from the unmaintained DBDeploy to Liquibase). These changes require a one-time migration of the GoCD database &amp;lt;= 20.4.0 to one compliant with GoCD 20.5.0 and beyond.&#xA;GoCD 20.</description>
