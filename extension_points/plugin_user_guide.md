# Plugin User Guide

## Introduction

Plugins allow users to extend the functionality of Go. Each plugin is assigned an identifier which is determined by the **id** attribute provided in plugin metadata file packaged along with the plugin jar. If the [metadata](https://developer.gocd.io/current/writing_go_plugins/go_plugins_basics.html#plugin-metadata) file is not packaged, plugin jar file name will be taken as plugin id. Plugins are classified into two categories - Bundled and External. During startup, Go server would try to load all the plugins. On successful load, the plugin will be converted into an OSGi bundle and extracted into `<server installation directory>/plugins_work` directory. **Plugins** tab, under Go server Administration, would list all the loaded plugins.

## Bundled versus External

-   **Bundled Plugins:** As the name suggests, bundled plugins are bundled/packaged along with Go server. These are developed and supported by Thoughtworks Go development team. Bundled plugins are located under `<server installation directory>/plugins/bundled` directory. After an upgrade, when Go server starts up for the first time, all bundled plugins would be refreshed with the latest packaged versions.

-   **External Plugins:** All user authored plugins are treated as external plugins. Unlike bundled plugins, external plugins are not altered (read packaged/bundled/refreshed/removed/modified) during a Go server upgrade. External plugins are loaded from `<server installation directory>/plugins/external` directory. [Listing of external plugins](http://www.gocd.io/community/plugins.html)

## Installing and Uninstalling of plugins

You need access to the Go server machine to be able to install/uninstall a plugin. To install a plugin, drop the plugin jar under the external plugin directory ( `<server installation directory>/plugins/external` ) and restart Go server. To uninstall a plugin, remove the plugin jar from the external plugin directory ( `<server installation directory>/plugins/external` ) and restart Go server.

You may also use [this](../beta/plugin_upload.html) beta feature to quick load plugins without restarting Go server.

## Plugins Tab

Plugins tab can be found under Go server Administration. Plugins tab shows all the plugins that have been loaded currently along with its details and status. If a plugin is marked invalid or incompatible, the reasons for the same would be reported here.

### Notes

-   Add/delete/upgrade of a plugin will take effect only after a Go server restart.
-   Two plugins cannot have same **id** irrespective of whether it is a bundled or an external plugin.
-   If two external plugins with same **id** are available, only one of them will be loaded successfully in no specific order.
-   If a bundled and an external plugin with same **id** are available, only bundled plugin wll be loaded.
