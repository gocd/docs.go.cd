### GoCD Agent not registering with the GoCD Server

This issue shows up either as an agent not showing up on the "Agents" page, or
showing up with a status of "Missing". If this happens, start troubleshooting by
looking at the agent log files.

See the end of [the installation documentation page](installing_go_agent.html)
for your operating system to find the location of the log files. There will be
log files for the agent, the agent-bootstrapper and agent-launcher. Any errors
at the end of these files might be interesting. Some common errors are:

1. **Unable to reach the GoCD Server**

   This manifests itself as logs in go-agent-launcher.log with lines similar to this:

       ERROR go.agent.launcher.ServerCall:69 - Couldn't access Go Server with base url: http://YOUR_SERVER:8153/go/admin/agent-launcher.jar: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
       ERROR go.agent.launcher.ServerBinaryDownloader:116 - Couldn't update admin/agent-launcher.jar. Sleeping for 1m. Error: java.lang.Exception: Couldn't access Go Server with base url: http://YOUR_SERVER:8153/go/admin/agent-launcher.jar: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
       INFO  apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector:438 - I/O exception (java.net.ConnectException) caught when processing request: Connection refused
       INFO  apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector:444 - Retrying request

   The problem here is that the agent cannot reach the server, either because of
   a problem with the network or because the ports used by the server are not
   accessible due to firewall restrictions. The GoCD server uses two ports, 8153
   and 8154 (by default). These two ports need to be accessible by the agents.

2. **Unable to connect - SSL handshake error or connection reset**

   This manifests itself as logs in go-agent-bootstrapper.out.log with lines similar to this:

        180679 [main] ERROR com.thoughtworks.go.agent.launcher.ServerCall  - Couldn't access Go Server with base url: https://YOUR_SERVER:8154/go/admin/agent-launcher.jar: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake

                at sun.security.ssl.InputRecord.read(Unknown Source)
                ... 28 more

   or this:

        2986 [main] ERROR com.thoughtworks.go.agent.launcher.ServerCall  - Couldn't access Go Server with base url: https://YOUR_SERVER:8154/go/admin/agent-launcher.jar: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
        java.lang.Exception: Couldn't access Go Server with base url: https://YOUR_SERVER:8154/go/admin/agent-launcher.jar: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
                at com.thoughtworks.go.agent.launcher.ServerCall.invoke(ServerCall.java:78)
                ...

   The problem here is that the agent is not able to connect securely to the
   server, which points to an invalid certificate. This can happen if an agent
   has connected to one GoCD server and is then pointed to another GoCD
   server. It will try to connect to the new server using the certificate that
   was for the older server and it will fail.

   The resolution is to move or rename the agent.jks file found the in the
   config/ directory of the agent and restarting the agent. That should make it
   connect using the correct certificate.

   If you're using full
   [end-to-end transport security](ssl_tls/end_to_end_transport_security.html),
   this error might mean that the server's certificate has changed and you need
   to provide the update certificate.

3. **Incompatible Java version**

   This manifests itself as logs in go-agent-bootstrapper.log with lines similar to this:

       242 [main] INFO com.thoughtworks.go.util.PerfTimer  - Performance: Downloading new admin/agent-launcher.jar with md5 signature: e9SXM6cdV5kSkpVEmymHIg== took 37ms

         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:622)
         at com.simontuffs.onejar.Boot.run(Boot.java:306)
         at com.simontuffs.onejar.Boot.main(Boot.java:159)
       Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/thoughtworks/cruise/agent/launcher/AgentLauncherImpl : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0

         at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:643)
         at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:142)

   The problem here is that the version of Java used by the agent is too old. In
   this example, Java 6 was used by an agent, with a 16.2.0 GoCD server, which
   needs Java 7.

### Command not found (git, svn, mvn, ant or others)

This issue shows up in one of three ways as you can see below. The resolution
for all three issues is the same -- to ensure that the `PATH` environment variable
is correct.

1. **During "Check Connection"**

   <figure>
     <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/error_4_check_connection_git_not_found.png">
   </figure>

   This can also happen with other version control systems such as SVN, TFS, etc.

   **Resolution**: Check the `PATH` environment variable of the GoCD **Server**'s java
   process. Ensure that the directory that the command is available is in the
   list. On Windows, the
   [procexp](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx)
   tool from Microsoft's Windows SysInternals might be useful to check this. It
   shows per-process environment variables in an easy way.

2. **During material polling**

   Look for an error message at the bottom-right of any page, which looks like this:
   <figure>
     <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/error_1.png">
   </figure>

   Clicking on that shows an error like this:
   <figure>
     <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/error_2_git_not_found.png">
   </figure>

   The GoCD server log, go-server.log (location can be found at the bottom of
   [the installation documentation page](installing_go_server.html) for your
   operating system) will have a message like this:
   <figure>
     <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/error_3_git_not_found_log.png">
   </figure>

   This can also happen with other version control systems such as SVN, TFS, etc.

   **Resolution**: Check the `PATH` environment variable of the GoCD **Server**'s java
   process. Ensure that the directory that the command is available is in the
   list. On Windows, the
   [procexp](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx)
   tool from Microsoft's Windows SysInternals might be useful to check this. It
   shows per-process environment variables in an easy way.

3. **During the running of a task, in the console output**

   This shows up as a message in the console output, like this:
   <figure>
     <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/error_5_command_not_found_console_log.png">
   </figure>

   This can also happen with other version control systems such as SVN, TFS, etc. It
   can also happen with any other command used in a task, such as Maven, Ant,
   Rake or even any other shell-script where it cannot be found in `PATH`.

   **Resolution**: Check the `PATH` environment variable of the GoCD **Agent's**
   java process. Ensure that the directory that the command is available is in
   the list. On Windows, the
   [procexp](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx)
   tool from Microsoft's Windows SysInternals might be useful to check this. It
   shows per-process environment variables in an easy way.

### Agent is not being assigned or "Nothing gets built"

This shows up as a pipeline which stays in the "Building" (yellow) state for a
long time:
<figure>
  <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/error_6_pipeline_building_not_assigned.png">
</figure>

Click on the stage bar and then the job, to reach the console log, and
you might see a build whose status is "Scheduled" with the agent status being "Not yet
assigned", like this:
<figure>
  <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/error_7_agent_not_assigned.png">
</figure>

Resolution: If this is happening, it means that a suitable agent has not been
found for this job. The reasons for this can be:

1. No agent is available (free and not building). Check the "Agents" page to see
   if all agents are busy. If so, once one of them becomes free, then this build
   will start.

2. If you do see available agents, then check whether the job has resources
   defined in its config. If so, it means that the job is looking for an agent
   with those resources. Check the "Agents" page to see whether there are agents
   which have the resources needed by the job and are available (not building).

3. If the previous two options don't solve the problem, check whether the
   pipeline is a part of an environment (in the "Environments" page or in the
   config). If it is, then any agent that can pick up a job from that pipeline
   needs to be a part of that environment as well.

### Mac OS X - Message related to Java 1.7

If you were greeted with a message such as this, when trying to use GoCD on Mac OSX:

<figure class="small_image">
  <img src="../resources/images/troubleshooting/troubleshoot_mac_installer.png"
    alt="Mac installer - Java 1.7+ message" title="Mac installer - Java 1.7+ message"/>
</figure>

you might have a Java installation in either a non-standard location or older
than Java 1.7. The GoCD Mac application tries to find the correct Java
installation to use, using this command:

```
/usr/libexec/java_home -v "1.7+"
```

If that fails, then you see the message shown above.

In case you are sure that you have Java 1.7 or newer installed, and the
application cannot find it at all, then the application can be forced to use a
Java installation of your choosing, using the ```GO_JAVA_HOME``` environment
variable. Suppose the ```Go Server.app``` file is in /Applications, and the Java
installation you want GoCD to use is at: ```/Library/MY_Java/Contents/Home```,
then you can start the GoCD Server with that Java using this (in a terminal
emulator):

```
GO_JAVA_HOME="/Library/MY_Java/Contents/Home" open "/Applications/Go Server.app"
```

Please note that this is used to set the Java home, and not the path to the
```java``` executable. Usually, GO_JAVA_HOME/bin/java will need to be a working
Java 1.7+ executable.

### Incompatible java version while upgrading to 17.x version

Java 7 support is removed as part of 17.1 release.
This implies an existing installation of Go will stop working after an upgrade
if it is configured to run with Java 7.

In such cases, one of the following error messages would be seen in the logs:

```
Unrecognized VM option "MaxMetaSpaceSize=256m"
```
or

```
Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
```

On Windows:

This error will be logged, in `<GO_INSTALLATION_DIR>/go-server-wrapper.log` on server and
`<GO_INSTALLATION_DIR>/go-agent-bootstrapper-wrapper.log` on agent, if startup failed due to incompatible version of Java.

Resolution: Update the environment variable `GO_SERVER_JAVA_HOME`, `GO_AGENT_JAVA_HOME`
to the Java 8 path and restart the Go server/agent.

On Linux:

This error will be logged, in `<GO_LOG_DIR>/go-server.out.log` on server and
`<GO_LOG_DIR>/go-agent-bootstrapper.log` on agent, if startup failed due to incompatible version of Java.

Resolution: Update the environment variable JAVA_HOME set in `/etc/default/go-server`, `/etc/default/go-agent`
to Java 8 path, and restart the Go server/agent.
