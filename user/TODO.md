## TODO

* Go now has more options in stage configuration than are shown in the screenshots. Other screen shots also need to be verified.
* Clean up the pages. Few pages have some junk texts that came up when converting to markdown format. These texts need to be removed from the files.
* Re-structure the documentation - based on community's decision.
* command_repository.md - change the link to new command repository once it's moved to gocd account. - @mdaliejaz looking into it
* package_material.md - need to finalise on plugins list URL, and change the link of go-command-repo - @mdaliejaz looking into it
