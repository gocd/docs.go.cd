      <description>Using your own SSL certificates on the Server The GoCD server on first startup will create a self-signed SSL certificate that is ready for use by you. However if have your own SSL certificate that you want to use with GoCD, you may replace GoCD&amp;rsquo;s certificate with your own.
Assuming that you have the certificate key (example.com.key) and X509 certificate(example.com.crt)
 Change the passphrase of the certificate key  If your key has a passphrase, you must first change the passphrase to serverKeystorepa55w0rd</description>

      <description>Configure a reverse proxy server to use with GoCD server It is sometimes useful to front GoCD with a proxy server. In this section, we give you some tips and examples on how to achieve this.
GoCD with Apache An example of how to configure GoCD with Apache is shown below.
Assumptions:
 You have Apache with mod_proxy installed The Apache server sits on the same machine as the GoCD server (localhost)  Listen nnn.</description>

      <description>Configure a GoCD agent to connect to a server through a proxy server. Note: Using this feature requires atleast version 17.11.0 of the GoCD server and agent.
Proxy support is configured with GoCD agents by passing certain system properties to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on startup. These properties follow the conventions defined by the JVM:
 http.proxyHost (default: ) http.proxyPort (default: 80) http.nonProxyHosts (default: localhost|127.*|[::1]) https.proxyHost https.proxyPort socksProxyHost socksProxyPort (default: 1080) socksProxyVersion (default: 5)  If your proxy server is running on proxy.</description>

      <description>Configuring GoCD server details Artifact repository configuration GoCD needs no configuration once installed. However, we recommend that you create a separate partition on your computer&amp;rsquo;s hard disk for GoCD server artifacts. The artifact repository can grow in size very quickly. If located on your system&amp;rsquo;s main partition you may experience data loss and unpredictable application behaviour as the disk fills up.
Once you have created a new disk partition, you need to tell GoCD where to find it.</description>

      <description>Configure end-to-end transport security Note: To ensure end-to-end transport encryption, please ensure that both your GoCD server and agent are running on atleast version 16.7.0
This section will help you configure and improve the security of the agent-to-server communication using correct SSL/TLS certificates and verification process.
The GoCD agent allows for some configuration to be able to configure and secure the end-to-end transport security to varying security levels.
The agent by default trusts any and all certificates offered to it, which may possibly allow for MITM attacks.</description>

      <description>Running GoCD agent via zip without installation If you want to run GoCD on a platform which does not have a native installer or want to run GoCD without installing it, you could do so by using the zip installers.
 Download the zip installer for GoCD agent Unzip the installer in a folder of your choice. It creates a subfolder with the name go-agent-${version} Set java in path  If you are on a Windows system, set GO_AGENT_JAVA_HOME to the installation path of java on the system If you are on a Unix system, set JAVA_HOME to the installation path of java on the system  Open a command prompt and go to the folder Start the agent  If you are on a Windows system, run start-agent.</description>

      <description>GoCD hardware specifications  Note: This page is still a work in progress. Please report issues and provide feedback at https://github.com/gocd/docs.go.cd/issues/76
 The hardware specifications for a GoCD server depends on a number of factors, this makes it difficult to estimate upfront the required hardware specifications and requires a bit of experimentation. The hardware specifications will depend on the current needs and future expansion plans.
Agent hardware requirements The agent hardware requirements are basically determined by the builds that are run.</description>

      <description> Installing GoCD agent You need to deploy at least one GoCD agent before you can build with GoCD. For the very simplest installation, you can run a GoCD agent on the same machine as your GoCD server.
Before you install the GoCD server or agent, please ensure that you meet the System Requirements.

      <description>Installing GoCD agent on Linux Installation of the GoCD agent using the package manager will require root access on the machine. You are also required to have a java version 8 (same version as the GoCD server) for the agent to run.
The installer will create a user called go if one does not exist on the machine. The home directory will be set to /var/go. If you want to create your own go user, make sure you do it before you install the GoCD agent.</description>

      <description>Upgrading GoCD To upgrade from a previous version of GoCD, it is only necessary to upgrade the Server. It is not necessary to stop or backup the GoCD Agents. Agents will automatically update to the correct version of GoCD.
Before you start Since Cruise 1.1 (legacy version of GoCD), we do not include a bundled version of the Subversion version control system. This means that if you use Subversion for your projects the server and all agents need to have Subversion installed and available on the system path.</description>
