# Configure your Kubernetes Cluster

Now that you have your Kubernetes cluster [set up and running](setup.md), youâ€™ll need to make the following configuration changes.

**1. Enable Ingress** - To expose the GoCD Kubernetes application to the internet, you will need an [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-controllers).

**2. Configure Service Account** - A [service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) is how Kubernetes manages roles and permissions. The default Kubernetes service account requires to be associated with the cluster-admin role to be able to install the GoCD application.

This configuration will be specific to your target Kubernetes environment.

## Option 1: Configure minikube

#### Enable Ingress

You can enable Ingress on minikube with this command

```bash
$ minikube addons enable ingress
   ingress was successfully enabled
```

#### Configure service account

The `kubeadm` toolkit helps to easily bootstrap a cluster so that appropriate privileges are granted for performing CRUD operations on RBAC resources.
Add the bootstrapper flag to the minikube start command as below. This may initially take several minutes to download and setup.

```bash
$ minikube start --bootstrapper kubeadm;
```

## Option 2: Configure GKE

#### Enable Ingress
GKE comes with Ingress enabled by default.

#### Configure service account
The `cluster-admin` role is a cluster level role that exists on GKE.

Associate the cluster role with the service account with a cluster role binding:
```bash
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding clusterRoleBinding \
--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
--serviceaccount=kube-system:default
```

## Option 3: Configure kops

#### Enable Ingress
To enable ingress for kops, you can configure an ingress controller of your own or an [ingress addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons) provided by kops.


#### Configure service account

Kops requires a cluster role and cluster role binding to be set up for the service account associated with the `Tiller` pod.

To create the cluster admin role, apply the following resource descriptor:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: cluster-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
```

Associate the cluster role with the service account with a cluster role binding:
```bash
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding clusterRoleBinding \
--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
--serviceaccount=kube-system:default
```
