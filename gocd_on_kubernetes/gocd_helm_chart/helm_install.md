# Install the GoCD Helm chart

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Kubernetes packages are called charts. Charts are curated applications for Kubernetes.  

Install the GoCD Helm chart with these commands:

```bash
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm install stable/gocd --name gocd --namespace gocd
```

## Access the GoCD server

After youâ€™ve installed the GoCD helm chart, you should be able to access the GoCD server from the Ingress IP.

The Ingress IP address can be obtained as specified below:

- Minikube

```bash
minikube ip
```
- Others

```bash
ip=$(kubectl get ingress --namespace gocd gocd-server -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
echo "http://$ip"
```

It might take a few minutes for the GoCD server to come up for the first time. You can check if the GoCD server is up with this command:

```bash
kubectl get deployments --namespace gocd
```
The column `Available` should show 1 for gocd-server.

The GoCD server on startup will look like this.

Now that you have accessed the GoCD server successfully, you will need to configure the Kubernetes elastic agent plugin.
