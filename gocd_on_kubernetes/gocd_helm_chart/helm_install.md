# Install the GoCD Helm chart

> Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Kubernetes packages are called charts. Charts are curated applications for Kubernetes.  


Install the GoCD Helm chart with this command:

```bash
$ helm install stable/gocd --name gocd --namespace gocd
```

## Access the GoCD server dashboard

After youâ€™ve installed the GoCD helm chart, you should be able to access the GoCD server dashboard from the Ingress IP.

The Ingress IP address can be obtained by using:
```bash
$ ip=$(kubectl get ingress --namespace gocd gocd-server -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
$ echo "http://$ip"
```

On minikube, the IP address can be obtained by running the command

```bash
$ minikube ip
```

The GoCD server on startup will look like this.

Now that you have accessed the dashboard successfully, you will need to configure the Kubernetes elastic agent plugin.
