# Conditional task execution

At times there are certain steps you need to execute only when you know that the build has already failed. For example, when a test suite fails you might want to output additional environment information to the console output

## Using web interface

Check the appropriate **Run if conditions** when defining the **Task**

## Using XML configuration

Usage: As a developer, I want to run a task only when the build has already failed.

- On the _Admin > Pipelines_ tab, edit the jobs that should run a task when the build has failed
- Ensure the following "task" block is in the job configuration
    ![](../images/2_conditional_task_config.png)
- Now we will get extra output only when the tests fail!

Possible run_if conditions

- passed
- failed
- any
