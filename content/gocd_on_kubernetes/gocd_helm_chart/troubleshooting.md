# Troubleshooting

1. Elevated privileges error:

    - `User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default" cannot get namespaces in the namespace "gocd": Unknown user "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default"`
    - `Error: release gocd failed: clusterroles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "<RBAC>" is forbidden: attempt to grant extra privileges:`

    The above 2 error messages occur if the service account associated with the tiller pod does not have the permissions to create the resources.
    Refer to the privileges section in the prerequisites to provide tiller elevated privileges.

2. Docker In Docker agent not working:

`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`

Make sure to have started the docker container with the privileged mode. For the Kubernetes elastic agent, edit the elastic profile in Admin -> Elastic Agent Profiles to check the `Privileged` mode.
