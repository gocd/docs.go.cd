# Create a pipeline to build and publish your application image

In this section, we'll go over how to design CD pipelines that build and publish an application image. As an example, we've used a [sample nodejs application](https://github.com/gocd-demo/node-bulletin-board) called 'Bulletin Board'.

### Prerequisites

We'll be building our application as a docker image artifact and publishing it to Docker Hub. To do this, make sure you have a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account. 

### Quick links

- [Getting started with GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/getting-started/part-1/)

## Build an application artifact

1. Click on the `Pipelines` link on the top menu to create your first pipeline.

2. Specify the [pipeline](../../introduction/concepts_in_go.html#pipeline) name and the group name as `build_and_publish_image` and `kubernetes_app_deployment` respectively.

3. Specify a git [material](../../introduction/concepts_in_go.html#materials) with repository `https://github.com/gocd-demo/node-bulletin-board.git`.

  ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/pipeline_wizard_add_material.png)

4. Create a [stage](../../introduction/concepts_in_go.html#stage) called `build_and_publish_image`.

  ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/pipeline_wizard_add_stage.png)

5. Create a [job](../../introduction/concepts_in_go.html#job) called `build_and_publish_image` with an initial task argument

  ```bash
    docker build -t $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/bulletin-board:$GO_PIPELINE_LABEL . -f Dockerfile.application
  ```

  > The `GO_PIPELINE_LABEL` is an environment variable provided by GoCD which can be used to differentiate between builds from a repository.

  Here we are using `GO_PIPELINE_LABEL` to determine the application image tag.

  *Note: This is the job that we have to associate with the elastic agent profile that we created earlier.*

  *Tip: Do not forget the `-c` option in the arguments section.*
  
  ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/pipeline_wizard_add_job.png)
  
  Click on the `Finish` button when you're done. This will take you to the pipeline settings page for additional configurations.
  
6. Navigate to Environment Variables tab. Configure the `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` as an environment variable.

  ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/configure_env_vars.png)
  

## Publish your application image to Docker Hub

1. Create an artifact store

    Navigate to Admin > Artifact Stores to add the global artifact store
        
    ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/artifact_store.png)

    
2.  Navigate to the pipeline settings for `build_and_publish_image`.

    *Tip: Use the tree on the left to navigate to the job `build_and_publish_image`. Once you're here, you can associate the profile ID under the Job Settings tab.*
    
    Create an external artifact under the `build_and_publish_image` job.

    Specify the artifact id as `bulletin-board`

    Specify the artifact store id as `dockerhub`

    Specify the `image` property as `${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/bulletin-board`

    Specify the `tag` property as `${GO_PIPELINE_LABEL}`
    
    This will ensure that the image being built by the `build_and_publish_image` job is the one being published.

   *Note: You need to have an artifact store configured for this so that the plugin is aware of the credentials to use when publishing the artifact.*

3. This is what the `Tasks` under the `build_and_publish_image` job should look like once you finish this configuration

  ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/build_and_publish_image_tasks.png)

## Associate job with the elastic profile

### Quick links

- [What are elastic profiles?](../../configuration/configuration_reference.html#agentProfile)

We have created a sample elastic profile `demo-app` for the helm release by default. Before associating elastic profile to a job, you'll need to verify that the elastic profile and plugin settings are set up.

### Step 1: Verify elastic profile

Navigate to Admin > Elastic Agent Profiles

![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/demo_app_profile.png)

You should be able to see `demo-app` in this.

*If the elastic profile does not exist or if you would like to create your own, refer to [this section](../gocd_helm_chart/configure_k8s_ea_plugin.html#create-an-elastic-profile)*

### Step 2: Verify Kubernetes elastic agent plugin

Navigate to Admin > Plugins and click on Status Report

![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/plugin_status.png)

If you're able to see a screen similar to the screenshot above, then the plugin has been configured.

*If the plugin settings have not been configured, refer to [this section](../gocd_helm_chart/configure_k8s_ea_plugin.html)*

### Step 3: Configure elastic profile ID for the job

Before you can run the pipeline, you'll need to associate an elastic profile ID with the job to be executed. To do this, go to the `Job Settings` tab of the specific job.

*Tip: Use the tree on the left to navigate to the job `build_and_publish_image`. Once you're here, you can associate the profile ID under the Job Settings tab.*

Once you've associated the job to the profile `demo-app`, you're ready to run the pipeline.

  ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/associate_job_with_profile.png)

## Run your pipeline

Now that the pipeline has been configured, we can run it and verify that the docker image has been pushed. 

To run the pipeline, unpause the pipeline in the GoCD dashboard. The changes from the source git repository gets picked up automatically when the pipeline is triggered.

![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/unpause.png)

## Check the status of agents with Agent Status Report

When the pipeline is running (signified by a yellow bar), you can take a look at the status of the agents that are assigned to run the jobs in the pipeline. You can find the following information here

- pod details & configuration

- pod events

- logs for the agents

This can be useful to troubleshoot when an agent is not picking up the job. 

To access the agent status report, 

1. Click on a stage of your choice when the pipeline is being built. 

2. You'll see the stage detail page with a list of jobs. Click on the job that you wish to see the agents of.   

3. This is the job detail page which has a console log. Click on the button titled 'Check Agent Status'. 

    ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/job_details.png)

4. Clicking on this will take you to the Agent Status Report where you can see --- 

    ![](../../images/gocd-helm-chart/agent_status_report.png)

    *Note: The Agent Status Report is only visible when that particular job is running. Once the job is run, this status will not be visible.*

## Verify your pipeline

Once the pipeline has run successfully, you can go to your DockerHub account to verify if the image has been published.

In the [next section](creating_a_test_pipeline.html), we'll look at how to configure a pipeline to test our sample application's docker image.
