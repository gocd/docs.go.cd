# Policy

A policy is a set of permissions for GoCD entities such as environments, configuration repositories, etc. The policy defines the access of a GoCD entity for the users in a role. GoCD supports a restrictive model of access i.e. until access is granted, the entity can't be accessed by anyone (except admins).

A permission consists of 3 values:

 1. __Type__: The type of GoCD entity. Supported values are `environment, config-repo`. Wildcard(`*`) is also permitted which means all supported values.
 2. __Action__: The action which is controlled. Supported values are `view` and `administer`
 3. __Resource__: The resource can be the name of entity or a pattern consisting of wildcard (`*`) matching one or more entities
   
Currently, GoCD has 2 types of permissions:

 - Allow: The allow permission grants access to the specified entity for the specific action.
 - Deny: The deny permission restricts the access to the specified entity for the specific action. 
 
 > __Note: If both the permission are specified for the same entity, the `deny` permission takes precendence.__
 
 
## Privilege-Action Matrix

Each GoCD entity has a set of actions which grants/restricts control on a granular level. The following matrix describes the same.

2. Go to **Admin** menu &rarr; **Role Configuration**.

    !["Navigate to role configuration"][1]

3. Click on `Add` button.

    !["Define Permission"][4]
    
7. Click on `Save` button.

Once the role has been created, go ahead and add users to the same. The access to the GoCD entities for these users will governed as per permissions configured.
